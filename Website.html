          <h4>Problems</h4>
          <p> In 2017, Marketing used a Wordpress template to build a very limited website when the Medly brand has not fully defined yet. In 2019, the homepage was redesigned with a new logo and color pallette and built by webflow. </p>
          <br>
          <p>The previous 2 versions had many accessibility issues by using green or image background, and didn't reflect the Medly brand goals which was bringing a fresh, modern, friendly feeling to our customers. Aesthetically it was a visual
            dumping ground which didnâ€™t do justice to the brand purpose. There was no structure to the content and a lot of important information are missing. It amplified confusion rather than coherency.</p>

    <h4>Audiences</h4>
    <p>The marketing website is definitely facing to all types of customers, to let them clearly understand what Medly is doing, and how Medly works. It is required to have a sign-up form on the website to allow more potential users switch to Medly.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Beside normal patients, the audiences also include investers, providers and manufacturers. We aimed to show them how fast the Medly had been evolved, and continuously build partnerships with them in the future.

  <!-- My Role -->
  <section id="MyRole">
    <h4>My Role</h4>
    <p>As a product owner, I worked closely with a project manager, a visual designer, and a webflow developer, managing the backlog epics on the Jira, and revised the design multiple times based on user research, information architecture analysis,
      new brand design guideline.
      I coordinated with Marketing Team and Brand Team to make sure our goals are aligned along the way.

    <h4>Discovery</h4>

    <h5>Card Sorting Test</h5>
    <p>Card Sorting Test is a method uncoverring how the target audienceâ€™s domain knowledge is structured, and it serves to create an information architecture that matches usersâ€™ expectations. I invited 15 consumer to do this test to learn how users
      understand and interact the current content and CTA.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h5>Steps</h5>
    <ul class="list-group">
      <li>1. Wrote 47 topics on the cards.</li>
      <li>2. Participants group cards into piles.</li>
      <li>3. Participants name each group.</li>
      <li>4. Participants explained their rationale why they grouped cards in that way.</li>
      <li>5. Use XSort tools to analyze the data collected.</li>
      <li>6. Reorganize the information based on the analysis.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Tree Testing and AB Testing</h5>
    <p>Tree testing helped me to know which option could allow audiences easier, faster to find the more accurate information without less back and forth clicks. I used Optimal Workshop to help me to measure the users actions.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h5>Steps</h5>
    <ul class="list-group">
      <li>1. Structure the 47 topics into A/B options in the OPTIMAL WORKSHOP.</li>
      <li>2. List 5 contents for users to look for.</li>
      <li>3. Invite 10 participants to find the 5 content in each option.</li>
      <li>4. Analyze data to compare which works better.</li>

      <h4>Information Architecture</h4>
      <br>
      <p>To provide users with an enjoyable experience on the website itâ€™s important to anticipate their needs to provide relevant information on each step. Therefore, different user types and their journeys informed the site structure. Based on
        this, it was possible to simplify user-flows between pages by removing unnecessary pages, merging existing and adding new when needed.

  <!-- Design System -->
  <section id="Visual-system">

    <h4>Design System</h4>
    <p>MThe new website needs to be aligned with the latest brand design guideline. To enhance the interaction and usability of the site, I redesign the color, typography size, button, and icons which meet the web accessibility standards (WCAG AA &
      WCAG AAA) and google material design guideline. </p>

  <!-- Solution -->
  <section id="Solution">
    <div class="text-container">
      <h4>The Outcome</h4>
      <p>The main point: each page needs to convey the goal and present main user questions and concerns. This information needs to be structured logically to allow users to scan the page quickly.</p>
      <p>Content always comes first, once logic and functionality are defined, the visual design process doesnâ€™t take long, and turns into an enjoyable meditation on aesthetic and design quality. Using wireframes and the modular system, the UI was created, following brand visual guidelines.</p>

      <h4>Challenge</h4>
      <ul class="list-group">
        <li>1. The project doesnâ€™t have a product manager, so I had to coordinate across the different funtional team and managed tasks. My time schedule became super tight especially when I had overloaded with design items.</li>
        <li>2. For first 2 versions, we never did a user research about the website, it was hard to educate stakeholders why the card sorting, tree testing and information architecture are important for a website design.</li>
        <li>3. During the card sorting, each participant had his own mental model and logics about grouping cards, how to find the similarities between users was challenging to me.</li>
      </ul>
